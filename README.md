Assignment Skills

* Add scripts to HTML
* Using basic JS functions and syntax:
    * Using functions
    * Declaring and assigning variables
    * Using comments to document code
    * Using loops
    * Basic input validation and type conversion
    * Using both if and switch statements

**Note:** Unfortunatly this project is not *currently* a good representation of commit messages as
    was an issue with publishing the repo to Github. However, as the project goes on I hope to improve
    their discriptiveness and on future projects avoid the issues I had with publishing the repo.
